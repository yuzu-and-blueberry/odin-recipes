    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shin Ramyun</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>0.5 Tablespoons Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>1 or 2 mushrooms of your choice</li>
        <li>Cheese (shredded or grated)</li>
        <li>Green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions to make your noodles fantastic!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You should have your ingredients prepped. Slice the mushrooms and green onions first. Grate the cheese if you are using block cheese.</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with enough water to just cover the noodles for it to cook. Bring water to a boil and cook for 3 minutes or until noodle texture is to your liking.</li>
        <li>I like my noodles spicy. Drain the water in the pot until it is barely covering the noodles.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and quickly add in the egg.  Stir the pot while adding in your shredded cheese and mushrooms.Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour eveything into a bowl. Add the sesame oil to the dish and mix it in. Garnish with green onion.</li>
    </ol>
